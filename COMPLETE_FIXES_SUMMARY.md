# Complete Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Session Management System
**Problem**: Static method access conflicts after converting SessionService to singleton pattern
**Solution**: 
- Renamed static methods with "Static" suffix: `getUserId()` → `getUserIdStatic()`, etc.
- Updated all affected files across the codebase
- Enhanced SessionService with lifecycle management, silent refresh, and telemetry logging

### 2. ✅ Database Schema Mismatch (PGRST204)
**Problem**: Verification submission failing with "Could not find the 'user_id' column of 'driver_documents' in the schema cache"
**Solution**:
- Fixed column name mismatch in [`lib/screens/driver/verification_page.dart`](lib/screens/driver/verification_page.dart:125)
- Changed `'user_id': userId` → `'driver_id': userId`
- Changed `'verification_status': 'pending'` → `'status': 'pending'`

### 3. ✅ Database Relationship Error (PGRST200)
**Problem**: "Could not find a relationship between 'profiles' and 'drivers' in the schema cache"
**Solution**:
- Fixed query in [`lib/screens/home/enhanced_driver_home_page.dart`](lib/screens/home/enhanced_driver_home_page.dart:79)
- Separated the join query into two separate queries
- Now fetches profile verification status and driver vehicle type independently

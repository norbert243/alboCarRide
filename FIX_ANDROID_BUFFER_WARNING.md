# Fix Android Buffer Warning

## Issue
You're seeing the warning:
```
W/ImageReader_JNI(20082): Unable to acquire a buffer item, very likely client tried to acquire more than maxImages buffers
```

## Cause
This warning is caused by the `image_picker` plugin not properly releasing camera resources on Android. It's a known issue with the plugin and doesn't affect functionality, but can be annoying during development.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Update image_picker plugin (Recommended)
Update to the latest version of image_picker in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
image_picker: ^1.1.1  # or latest version
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Solution 2: Add Android configuration
Add the following to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="flutterEmbedding"
    android:value="2" />

<!-- Add camera features requirement -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" android:required="false" />
```

### Solution 3: Suppress the warning (Development only)
For development, you can suppress this specific warning by adding to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
android {
    // ... existing code
    
    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
        checkReleaseBuilds false
    }
}
```

### Solution 4: Use alternative approach for image picking
If the warning persists, consider using `file_picker` as an alternative:

```yaml
file_picker: ^6.1.1
```

## Important Notes

1. **This warning does NOT affect the Google Maps functionality** - the map will work perfectly fine
2. **It's a development-only warning** - won't appear in release builds
3. **The warning is harmless** - doesn't crash the app or affect performance
4. **The map implementation is complete and functional** regardless of this warning

## Verification
To confirm the map is working:
1. The map should display (may show gray tiles without API key)
2. Location permission should be requested
3. The loading states and error handling should work
4. The retry button should function

The buffer warning is completely separate from the Google Maps implementation and doesn't indicate any issues with the map functionality.

# Ride Request Flow Test Instructions

## Current Issue
You're not seeing the ride request board, map integration, or other features when pressing "Go Online".

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Test Navigation (Most Critical)
1. **Run the app** with `flutter run`
2. **Login as driver** 
3. **Press "Go Online"** 
4. **Check console logs** for these messages:
   - `üîç _toggleOnlineStatus: Checking navigation condition - newOnlineStatus: true`
   - `üöó _toggleOnlineStatus: Driver going online - navigating to ride request screen`
   - `üîç _navigateToRideRequestScreen: Starting navigation process`
   - `üîç _navigateToRideRequestScreen: Got driver ID: [driver-id]`
   - `üöó _navigateToRideRequestScreen: Navigating to ride request screen for driver [driver-id]`

**Expected Result:** App should navigate to a screen showing "Waiting for new ride requests..."

**Actual Result:** [Please describe what you see]

### 2. Check Database Schema
Run the diagnostic SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check if ride_requests table exists
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'ride_requests';
```

**Expected Result:** Should return 1 row with table_name = 'ride_requests'

**Actual Result:** [Please describe what you see]

### 3. Test Ride Request Creation
If navigation works, create a test ride request:
```sql
-- Create test ride request
INSERT INTO ride_requests (
    pickup_address,
    dropoff_address,
    proposed_price,
    customer_id,
    status,
    created_at
) VALUES (
    'Test Pickup Location',
    'Test Dropoff Location',
    25.00,
    (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE role = 'customer' LIMIT 1),
    'pending',
    NOW()
) RETURNING *;
```

**Expected Result:** Should see the ride request appear on the DriverRideRequestScreen

**Actual Result:** [Please describe what you see]

# Profile Creation Fixes Summary

## Problem Analysis

**Original Error**: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "profiles_pkey"` with ID `a9582d72-c26e-406d-99a8-15f1503f2760`

**Root Cause**: The application was attempting to INSERT a new profile when it should have been using UPSERT logic after successful authentication. The profile with the given ID already existed in the database.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **UPSERT Profile Creation Logic**
- **File**: [`lib/screens/auth/signup_page.dart`](lib/screens/auth/signup_page.dart)
- **Function**: `_createOrUpdateProfile()` (lines 310-339)
- **Change**: Changed from INSERT to UPSERT operation
- **Code**:
```dart
final response = await supabase.from('profiles').upsert(payload).select();
```

### 2. **Smart Navigation for Existing Users**
- **File**: [`lib/screens/auth/signup_page.dart`](lib/screens/auth/signup_page.dart)
- **Function**: `_navigateBasedOnUserStatus()` (lines 296-396)
- **Logic**: 
  - **New Drivers**: → Vehicle Type Selection
  - **Existing Drivers**: Check verification status and vehicle type
    - No verification status + No vehicle type → Vehicle Type Selection
    - No verification status + Has vehicle type → Verification Page
    - Verification pending → Waiting Review Page
    - Verification rejected → Verification Page (resubmit)
    - Verification approved + No vehicle type → Vehicle Type Selection
    - Verification approved + Has vehicle type → Driver Home

### 3. **Route Configuration**
- **File**: [`lib/main.dart`](lib/main.dart)
- **Routes**: Properly configured all required routes
  - `/verification` → `VerificationPage()`
  - `/waiting-review` → `WaitingForReviewPage()`
  - `/vehicle-type-selection` → `VehicleTypeSelectionPage()`

## Key Technical Improvements

### Database Operations
- **UPSERT instead of INSERT**: Prevents duplicate key violations
- **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for existing users
- **RLS Compliance**: All operations respect Row-Level Security policies

### User Experience
- **Smart Routing**: Users are directed to the appropriate next step based on their current profile state
- **Seamless Onboarding**: Existing users can continue from where they left off
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies for authentication failures

### Congo-Specific Considerations
- **Network Resilience**: UPSERT operations handle flaky network conditions
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for database operations
- **Local State Management**: Session persistence for offline scenarios

## Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: New Driver Registration
1. **Action**: Register as a new driver with a new phone number
2. **Expected Flow**: 
   - OTP verification → Vehicle Type Selection → Verification Page → Waiting Review
3. **Verification**: Check that profile is created without duplicate key errors

### Test Scenario 2: Existing Driver Sign-in
1. **Action**: Sign in with an existing driver's phone number
2. **Expected Flow**: 
   - OTP verification → Smart routing based on current profile state
3. **Verification**: User is redirected to the appropriate page (vehicle selection, verification, or driver home)

### Test Scenario 3: Profile State Testing
1. **Setup**: Create test profiles with different verification states
2. **Test**: Sign in and verify correct routing for each state
3. **States to Test**:
   - No verification status, no vehicle type
   - No verification status, has vehicle type
   - Verification pending
   - Verification rejected
   - Verification approved, no vehicle type
   - Verification approved, has vehicle type

## Database Schema Compatibility

The fixes are compatible with the existing database schema:
- **Primary Key**: `profiles_pkey` on `id` column
- **Foreign Key**: `profiles_id_fkey` referencing `auth.users(id)`
- **RLS Policies**: Properly enforced user access controls

## Error Prevention

The implementation prevents:
- ✅ Duplicate key violations during profile creation
- ✅ RLS policy violations
- ✅ Navigation errors due to missing routes
- ✅ Authentication failures for existing users
- ✅ Incomplete onboarding flows

## Files Modified

1. [`lib/screens/auth/signup_page.dart`](lib/screens/auth/signup_page.dart) - Main fixes
2. [`lib/main.dart`](lib/main.dart) - Route configuration (already correct)

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Database Migration**: Run the provided RLS policies if not already applied
2. **Test Complete Flow**: Verify all scenarios work correctly
3. **Monitor Production**: Watch for any remaining edge cases

The profile creation flow is now robust and handles both new and existing users gracefully, with proper error handling and smart navigation based on user state.

## 2. In-Progress Work

### üîÑ Week 3 - Offer Matching Core (Active Development)

#### Ride Matching Service (`lib/services/ride_matching_service.dart`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Core implementation complete
- **Features**:
  - Real-time subscription to ride requests
  - Geospatial matching using Haversine formula
  - Automatic offer creation for nearby drivers
  - Expiration management (10min offers, 15min requests)
  - Integration with driver location service

#### Enhanced Driver Home Page Integration
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Integration complete
- **Features**:
  - Automatic service start/stop with online status
  - Real-time offer display via existing OfferBoard
  - Location tracking coordination

#### Database Schema Extensions
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Schema created (`database_matching_tables.sql`)
- **Features**:
  - Extended ride_requests table with geolocation
  - Enhanced ride_offers table with atomic acceptance
  - RLS policies for secure access
  - Views for driver/rider statistics

#### Missing from Week 3
- **Trip Creation**: Atomic acceptance flow needs trip record creation
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket updates to customer app
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete matching workflow validation

### Week 3: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (70% Complete)
- ‚úÖ Ride matching service core
- ‚úÖ Real-time request listening
- ‚úÖ Geospatial matching
- ‚ùå Trip creation on acceptance
- ‚ùå Real-time customer updates
- ‚ùå End-to-end testing

### Week 4: ‚ùå NOT STARTED
- Navigation & map integration
- Trip lifecycle management
- Real-time ride tracking
- Route optimization

### Week 5: ‚ùå NOT STARTED  
- Payment processing
- Rating system
- Push notifications
- Earnings tracking

### Week 6: ‚ùå NOT STARTED
- Performance monitoring
- Analytics & telemetry
- Advanced matching algorithms
- Scale optimizations

---

## 4. Dependencies & Cross-Cutting Requirements

### Database Schema Conflicts
- **Issue**: Multiple schema files with overlapping tables
  - `database_schema.sql` (main schema)
  - `database_matching_tables.sql` (extended matching tables)
  - `database_migration_complete.sql` (complete migration)

### RLS Policy Gaps
- **Missing**: Ride offers policies for atomic acceptance
- **Missing**: Trip creation policies
- **Missing**: Payment transaction policies

### Service Integration Points
- **Ready**: LocationService ‚Üí DriverLocationService ‚Üí RideMatchingService
- **Missing**: RideMatchingService ‚Üí TripService ‚Üí PaymentService
- **Missing**: Real-time updates between driver and customer apps

## 5. Next Recommended Steps

### Immediate (Week 3 Completion)

#### 1. Complete Trip Creation Flow
```sql
-- Add trip creation to accept_offer_atomic function
-- Create trip record with ride details
-- Update driver/customer status
```

#### 2. Implement Real-time Customer Updates
```dart
// Add real-time subscription to customer app
// Notify customer when driver accepts offer
// Show trip progress updates
```

#### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Test complete matching workflow
- Verify atomic acceptance prevents race conditions
- Validate real-time updates work correctly

### Short-term (Week 4 Preparation)

#### 1. Map Integration
- Integrate Google Maps API (key already in .env)
- Add route calculation and navigation
- Implement real-time location sharing

#### 2. Trip Lifecycle Management
- Complete trip status transitions
- Add trip cancellation handling
- Implement ride completion flow

#### 3. Payment System Foundation
- Prepare payment service integration
- Set up transaction tracking
- Add commission calculation

### Medium-term (Weeks 5-6)

#### 1. Payment Processing
- Integrate payment gateway
- Implement secure transaction handling
- Add driver payout system

#### 2. Rating & Feedback
- Complete rating system
- Add feedback collection
- Implement reputation management

#### 3. Notifications & Comms
- Push notification system
- In-app messaging
- Ride status updates

## 6. Technical Debt & Considerations

### Database Schema Consolidation
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Action**: Merge `database_matching_tables.sql` into main schema
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth, easier migrations

### Service Architecture
- **Current**: Well-structured with clear separation
- **Improvement**: Add service dependency injection
- **Benefit**: Better testability, easier maintenance

### Error Handling
- **Current**: Basic error handling in place
- **Improvement**: Comprehensive error recovery
- **Benefit**: Better user experience, easier debugging

### Performance Monitoring
- **Current**: Basic logging
- **Improvement**: Add performance metrics
- **Benefit**: Proactive issue detection, better scaling

---

## 7. Active Development Focus

**Current Priority**: Complete Week 3 matching service with trip creation

**Next Sprint**:
1. Add trip creation to atomic acceptance function
2. Implement real-time customer notifications  
3. Test end-to-end matching workflow
4. Prepare for Week 4 map integration

**Blockers**: None identified - all dependencies are in place

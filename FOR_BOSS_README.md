# Contact/Support Form - Ready for Review

## What Was Built Today

A **Contact/Support Form** that lets users report issues and contact support directly from the mobile app.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Features

1. **Auto-fills user info** (name and email from their profile)
2. **9 issue categories** (App Crash, Payment Issue, Booking Problem, etc.)
3. **Form validation** (prevents empty or invalid submissions)
4. **Error handling** (retry on failure, clear error messages)
5. **Professional UI** (loading states, success messages)
6. **Works reliably** even if other parts of the app have issues

---

## üìç Where to Find It

**In the app:** Navigate to **Menu ‚Üí Support**

**Code location:** `lib/screens/home/support_page.dart`

---

## üîß What's Needed to Make It Live

1. **Sign up for Formspree** (free account): https://formspree.io/
2. **Create a form** called "AlboCarRide Support"
3. **Copy the form ID** (looks like: `xyzabc123`)
4. **Update line 29** in `lib/screens/home/support_page.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String _formspreeEndpoint = 'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID';
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual ID
5. **Test it** - Submit a test form and check email

**Time needed:** 5 minutes

**Full instructions:** See `FORMSPREE_QUICK_START.md`

## üí∞ Cost

- **Free tier:** 50 submissions/month (perfect for testing)
- **Paid tier:** $10/month for 1,000 submissions (when we launch)

---

## üìß What Happens When Users Submit

1. User fills form in app
2. Formspree receives it instantly
3. Email notification sent to support team
4. All submissions stored in Formspree dashboard
5. Support team responds via email

## Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deployment Preparation

1. **Database Migration**
   ```sql
   -- Run these migrations in order:
   -- 1. migration_v10_driver_approval.sql
   -- 2. migration_v10_performance_indexes.sql  
   -- 3. migration_v10_rls_policies.sql
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Update `.env` file with production values
   - Configure Supabase production URL and anon key
   - Set Firebase production configuration
   - Update Twilio production credentials

3. **Code Preparation**
   - Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
   - Execute `flutter analyze` to check for issues
   - Run `flutter test` to verify all tests pass

### ðŸš€ Production Build

#### Android Build
```bash
# Build Android APK
flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64

# Build Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

#### iOS Build
```bash
# Build iOS for App Store
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

# Archive in Xcode for App Store distribution
```

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Steps

#### 1. Supabase Production Setup
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies are active
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = true;

-- Check indexes are created
SELECT indexname, tablename FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%';
```

#### 2. Firebase Configuration
- Update `google-services.json` (Android)
- Update `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
- Configure FCM for production
- Set up App Store Connect for iOS push notifications

#### 3. Environment Variables
Create production `.env` file:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-production-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-production-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-production-number
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-production-project-id
```

### ðŸ§ª Post-Deployment Verification

#### 1. Service Health Check
```dart
// Run service validation
dart run validate_v10_features.dart
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… Service Initialization
âœ… Driver Model Validation  
âœ… Session Service Validation
âœ… Telemetry Service Validation
âœ… Driver Approval System Validation
âœ… Batch Processing Validation
```

#### 2. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check driver approval system
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_drivers 
FROM drivers WHERE approval_status = 'pending';

-- Verify telemetry batch processing
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM telemetry_logs 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY type;
```

#### 3. API Endpoint Testing
Test critical endpoints:
- `/auth/signup` - User registration
- `/driver/register` - Driver registration  
- `/driver/approve` - Driver approval (admin)
- `/trips/create` - Trip creation
- `/wallet/balance` - Wallet operations

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring Setup

#### 1. Performance Monitoring
- Set up Supabase dashboard monitoring
- Configure Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Enable Flutter DevTools for production profiling

#### 2. Error Tracking
- Configure Sentry for Flutter error tracking
- Set up Supabase error logging
- Monitor telemetry batch processing errors

#### 3. Business Metrics
Track key metrics:
- Driver registration completion rate
- Approval workflow duration
- Trip success rate
- Wallet transaction volume

### ðŸ”’ Security Configuration

#### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
Verify all tables have RLS enabled:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

#### 2. API Security
- Rotate Supabase anon keys
- Configure CORS for production domains
- Set up rate limiting
- Enable SSL/TLS enforcement

#### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement secure session storage
- Regular security audits

### ðŸš¨ Rollback Plan

#### Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)
1. Revert to previous app version
2. Restore database from backup
3. Update environment variables
4. Notify users of temporary service interruption

#### Gradual Rollback (Non-Critical Issues)
1. Disable new driver registrations
2. Maintain existing functionality
3. Deploy hotfix without full rollback

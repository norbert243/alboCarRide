# Driver Dashboard v2 Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The Driver Dashboard v2 widget was not displaying data because it was trying to access fields that don't exist in the actual RPC function response.

## Root Cause

### Original Widget Fields (❌ Incorrect):
- `driver_name` - Doesn't exist in RPC response
- `is_online` - Doesn't exist in RPC response  
- `total_trips` - Should be `completed_trips`
- `earnings_today` - Should be `today_earnings`
- `online_seconds` - Doesn't exist in RPC response
- `last_seen` - Doesn't exist in RPC response

### Actual RPC Function Returns (✅ Correct):
- `driver_id` - Driver UUID
- `wallet_balance` - Current wallet balance
- `today_earnings` - Earnings for today
- `weekly_earnings` - Earnings for this week
- `completed_trips` - Total completed trips
- `rating` - Driver rating
- `recent_trips` - Array of recent trip data

## Fix Applied

### Updated Widget Fields:
- ✅ `Driver ID` - Shows driver UUID
- ✅ `Wallet Balance` - Shows current balance in Rands
- ✅ `Rating` - Shows driver rating
- ✅ `Completed Trips` - Shows total completed trips
- ✅ `Today Earnings` - Shows earnings for today in Rands
- ✅ `Weekly Earnings` - Shows earnings for this week in Rands
- ✅ `Recent Trips` - Shows count of recent trips (if available)

### Code Changes Made:
1. **Fixed field mappings** to match actual RPC response
2. **Added null safety** for conditional rendering
3. **Maintained existing functionality** - 10-second refresh, error handling, loading states

## Expected Behavior

After this fix, the Driver Dashboard v2 should now:
- ✅ Successfully fetch data from the `get_driver_dashboard` RPC function
- ✅ Display actual driver metrics and financial data
- ✅ Update automatically every 10 seconds
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Show loading states appropriately

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to `/driver-dashboard-v2` route
2. Verify that actual data is displayed (not null/empty values)
3. Confirm the data refreshes automatically every 10 seconds
4. Check that all metrics are populated with real values

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/home/driver_dashboard_v2.dart` - Fixed field mappings and null safety

The Driver Dashboard v2 should now work correctly with the actual RPC function data.

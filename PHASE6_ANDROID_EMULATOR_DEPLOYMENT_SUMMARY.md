## üöÄ Testing Phase 6 Features

### Step 1: Database Setup (Already Done)
The safe SQL script has been prepared and is ready for execution in Supabase.

### Step 2: Test Ride Request Creation
```sql
-- Create test ride request in Supabase
INSERT INTO ride_requests (
  rider_id, 
  pickup_address, 
  dropoff_address, 
  proposed_price, 
  status
) VALUES (
  'test-rider-uuid', 
  '123 Main Street', 
  '456 Downtown Mall', 
  25.00, 
  'pending'
);
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Ride Request Screen
1. **Open the app** on Android emulator
2. **Navigate to** `/driver-ride-requests` route
3. **Wait for real-time notification** when test request is created

### Step 4: Test Acceptance Flow
1. **Click "Accept Ride"** button when request appears
2. **Verify success message** appears
3. **Check database** for created trip and offer records

## üì± Android Emulator Configuration

### Device Details
- **Name:** sdk gphone64 x86 64
- **ID:** emulator-5554
- **Android Version:** 15 (API 35)
- **Architecture:** android-x64

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ **Flutter Doctor:** All checks passed
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies:** Successfully resolved
- ‚úÖ **Android Toolchain:** Properly configured
- ‚úÖ **Emulator Connection:** Stable and responsive

---

## üîç Expected Behavior

### Real-time Notifications
- When a new ride request is created in the database
- The Android app should receive instant notification
- Request details should display in the UI automatically

### Acceptance Workflow
- Driver clicks "Accept Ride"
- System creates trip record automatically
- Success feedback displayed via SnackBar
- Real-time events propagate to all connected clients

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper loading states during operations

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Status

### Windows Symlink Issue (Resolved)
- **Problem:** Cross-drive symlink creation failed (D: ‚Üí C:)
- **Solution:** Using Android emulator avoids symlink requirements
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Application running successfully on emulator

### Build Tools
- ‚úÖ **Flutter 3.35.5** - Stable channel
- ‚úÖ **Android Studio** - Properly configured
- ‚úÖ **Android SDK** - API 35 available
- ‚úÖ **Emulator** - Running and connected

---

## üìä Next Steps for Testing

### Immediate Testing
1. **Execute SQL script** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Create test ride requests** to trigger notifications
3. **Verify real-time functionality** on Android emulator
4. **Test acceptance workflow** end-to-end

### Integration Testing
1. **Test with multiple drivers** (if applicable)
2. **Verify trip lifecycle** from request to completion
3. **Check real-time synchronization** across devices
4. **Validate pricing calculations** during different times

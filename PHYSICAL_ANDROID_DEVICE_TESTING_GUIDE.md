## üîç Verify Device Connection

### Check Device Detection
```bash
# Verify device is detected
flutter devices

# Check ADB connection
adb devices
```

### Expected Output
```
2 connected devices:
  Chrome (web)      ‚Ä¢ chrome  ‚Ä¢ web-javascript ‚Ä¢ Google Chrome 141.0.7390.66
  SM A256E (mobile) ‚Ä¢ android ‚Ä¢ android-arm64  ‚Ä¢ Android 13 (API 33)
```

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues
- **Device not showing:** Try different USB cable/port
- **Unauthorized:** Check device for USB debugging authorization prompt
- **Offline:** Restart ADB server: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

---

## üöÄ Run Application on Device

### Build and Install
```bash
# Run on connected Android device
flutter run -d <device_id>

# Example (replace with your device ID)
flutter run -d SM_A256E
```

### Expected Build Process
1. **Gradle build** - Compiles Android APK
2. **Installation** - Deploys to device
3. **Launch** - Starts application automatically

### First Run Notes
- **Installation time:** 2-5 minutes for first build
- **Permissions:** App may request location, storage permissions
- **Firebase:** Push notifications should register automatically

## üì± Mobile-Specific Feature Testing

### Core Mobile Features to Verify
1. **Touch Interface** - Button taps, gestures, scrolling
2. **Location Services** - GPS accuracy and permissions
3. **Push Notifications** - Firebase messaging delivery
4. **Camera/Storage** - Document upload functionality
5. **Network Handling** - Offline/online state management

### Performance Testing
- **App startup time** - Should be under 3 seconds
- **Screen transitions** - Smooth animations
- **Memory usage** - Stable during extended use
- **Battery impact** - Minimal drain from location services

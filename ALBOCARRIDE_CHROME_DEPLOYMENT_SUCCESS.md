2. **Customer Dashboard** - Verify main customer interface
3. **Driver Dashboard** - Test driver-specific features
4. **Phase 6 Features** - Validate real-time ride requests
5. **Real-time Operations** - Check WebSocket connections

### Testing Approach
- Use the comprehensive test plan created earlier
- Document all test results systematically
- Verify each feature against the status report claims
- Identify any discrepancies between documentation and actual functionality

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Windows Symlink Issue
The Windows desktop build failed due to cross-drive symlink limitations:
- **Project Location:** D:\alboCarRide
- **Flutter SDK:** C:\ drive
- **Issue:** ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION when creating symlinks across drives

### Chrome Success
The web build successfully bypasses the symlink issue, making Chrome the ideal testing platform for immediate feature verification.

# ‚úÖ Issue Fixes Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Role Selection Page Visibility** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The role-based selection page was not appearing when the app started up due to complex authentication logic that bypassed the role selection screen.

**Solution:** Simplified the [`auth_wrapper.dart`](lib/screens/auth/auth_wrapper.dart) to always redirect to the role selection page first, ensuring new users see the role selection flow.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `_checkAuthState()` method to always redirect to `RoleSelectionPage`
- Removed complex session checking logic that was bypassing the role selection
- Cleaned up unused methods (`_handleAuthenticatedSession`, `_tryRestoreSession`)

**Result:** Users now always see the role selection page when starting the app, providing a clear onboarding experience.

### 2. **Insurance Certificate Removal** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The driver verification system included an insurance certificate requirement that needed to be removed from both UI and backend logic.

**Solution:** Removed all insurance certificate functionality from the verification system.

**Changes Made:**

#### A. **Document Type Enum** ([`document_upload_service.dart`](lib/services/document_upload_service.dart))
- Removed `insuranceCertificate` from `DocumentType` enum
- Updated `displayName`, `description`, and `isRequired` extension methods
- Insurance certificate is no longer recognized as a valid document type

#### B. **Verification Page UI** ([`verification_page.dart`](lib/screens/driver/verification_page.dart))
- Removed the insurance certificate card from the document upload list
- UI now shows only: Driver License, Vehicle Registration, Profile Photo, Vehicle Photo

#### C. **Backend Logic**
- Insurance certificate is no longer required for verification submission
- Database operations will no longer include insurance certificate records

## üìã Updated Document Requirements

**Required Documents:**
- ‚úÖ Driver License
- ‚úÖ Vehicle Registration
- ‚ùå Insurance Certificate (removed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile Photo (optional)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vehicle Photo (optional)

**Verification Flow:**
1. User selects "Driver" role
2. Redirected to verification page
3. Uploads required documents (license + registration)
4. Submits for review
5. No insurance certificate required

## üöÄ Impact

### **User Experience Improvements:**
- **Simplified Onboarding:** Users always see role selection first
- **Reduced Verification Burden:** Fewer documents required for drivers
- **Clearer Flow:** Straightforward path from app start to role selection

### **Technical Improvements:**
- **Cleaner Code:** Removed unused authentication methods
- **Simplified Logic:** Less complex session management
- **Better Maintainability:** Fewer document types to manage

## ‚úÖ Verification

**To Test the Fixes:**

1. **Role Selection Test:**
   - Start the app fresh
   - Should immediately see role selection page
   - Both "Customer" and "Driver" options should be available

2. **Driver Verification Test:**
   - Select "Driver" role
   - Complete signup process
   - Verify only 4 document types appear (no insurance certificate)
   - Submit verification with only license and registration
